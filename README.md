# Hoagies-ordering-menu

In this project I create an class object (a hoagie) and methods to call it's attributes 
(The bun of the hoagie, the meat of the hoagie, and the toppings of the hoagie).

In the ordering system I utilize variables to display greetings, phrases, control a while loop.
I utilized arraylists for my 3 attributes and stored the ordering options inside an arraylist. 

This system recieves input (using the scanner method) from a user and prompts the user what kind of bread, meat, topping they want for thier hoagie.

The system allows for multiple toppings using a while loop and displays the results for the entire order at the end to the user. 

Using the I/O file reader/writter method, this system also writes a record of the order and saves it to a doc for ethier reciept purposes or documentation purposes.
